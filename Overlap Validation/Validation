# Overlap Validation Pipeline

## Step 1: Clean BED file and sort
cut -f1-3 input_raw.bed | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > input_clean_sorted.bed

## Step 2: Intersect with target ATAC-seq peaks to validate conservation
bedtools intersect -a input_clean_sorted.bed -b atac_peaks.bed -u > validated_overlap.bed

## Step 3: Calculate overlap percentage
wc -l input_clean_sorted.bed > total_regions.txt
wc -l validated_overlap.bed > conserved_regions.txt
